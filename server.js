/*
HARD-CODED DATA
What we've done here is mocked up what a database object would hypothetically look like
if we had one. That's why we've included an idea. We're trying to simulate the data so that
when we do hook up the database later, it's a seamless transition.

First get your routes hooked up and the ejS looking the way you want. When you are
ready to proceed with hooking up the database, go to ./models/album to create a schema.
Then, take a look into the seed.js file to populate some starter data.
